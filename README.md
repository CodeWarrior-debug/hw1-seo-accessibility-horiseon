# hw1-seo-accessibility-horiseon
> This is a sample website for a fictitious web presence management company. I undertook this as my first graded UNCC coding bootcamp exercise focusing on SEO and accessibility. Refactoring and repairing this from code, files, and criteria that were supplied was my first independent experience with controlling CSS and showed me 1) the importance of adopting classes in the right locations in the HTML sheet 2) the importance of reviewing everything first and mapping out where changes do/don't need to be made before making even a single change and 3) how to develop a basic add/commit/status/push routine with gitBash. Good exercise but definitely took time.

## Development Tasks Performed

- Built a nice readme to spec.
- Added well-phrased accessibility alt tags.
- ...And Many More...

## Contributing
>Thanks for the thought, but without the original instructions set and broken code (not included), this repo will not be convenient to use for anyone else trying to become proficient with CSS. :( And I'm onto bigger and better projects. :)
